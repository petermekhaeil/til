# Smart App Banners

The banners on top of web apps that promote the native version of the app is controlled using a `<meta>` tag in the HTML:

```html
<meta name="apple-itunes-app" content="app-id=1477376905, app-argument=https://github.com/" />
```

See the [documentation on Promoting Apps with Smart App Banners
](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/promoting_apps_with_smart_app_banners). This only works for iOS Safari.
