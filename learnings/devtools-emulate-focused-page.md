# Emulate a focused page in DevTools

If you switch focus from the current page to the Chrome DevTools, some overlay elements automatically hide if they are triggered by focus. For example, dropdown menus.

The Chrome DevTools have a feature to emulate page focus. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and search for "Emulate a focused page". You won't lose focus of the page while inspecting the elements.
